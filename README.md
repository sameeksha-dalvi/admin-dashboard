# Admin Dashboard

This is a simple admin dashboard project from [The Odin Project’s Intermediate HTML and CSS course](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard).

The goal of this project was to practice **CSS Grid** and build a clean layout similar to a real admin panel. It includes a sidebar, a header, and a main content area with cards and small sections.

Right now, the layout is **not responsive**, but it looks good on desktop screens. I’ll make it responsive later.

## Built With
- HTML  
- CSS (mainly Grid and Flexbox)
